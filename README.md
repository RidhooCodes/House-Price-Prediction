# House Prices Prediction

## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a predictive model for house prices using machine learning techniques. The dataset contains housing-related variables, and the goal is to build a reliable model that can accurately predict house prices based on these features. This project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and interpretation.

## Key Features
- Data Cleaning: Handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistent data.
- Exploratory Data Analysis: Visualizing trends and relationships among features.
- Feature Engineering: Transforming raw data into meaningful features for modeling.
- Model Building: Training and evaluating multiple machine learning models.
- Model Tuning: Hyperparameter optimization using techniques like `RandomizedSearchCV`.
- Results Interpretation: Using visualizations and metrics to explain model performance.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project includes variables such as:
- `Median House Value`: Median house value for households within a block (measured in US Dollars) (target variable)
- `Median Income`: Median income for households within a block of houses (measured in tens of thousands of US Dollars) [10k$]
- `Median Age`: Median age of a house within a block; a lower number is a newer building [years]
- `Total Rooms`: Total number of rooms within a block
- `Total Bedrooms`: Total number of bedrooms within a block
- `Population`: Total number of people residing within a block

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`
- Jupyter Notebook for exploratory data analysis
